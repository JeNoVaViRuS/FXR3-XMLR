This is a fork made by "The12thAvenger". I simply added ContextMenu exes.

About:
FXR3-XMLR is a tool used to convert ".fxr" in a serialized and editable XML Document and vise versa.

Credits:
@TKGP Soulsformats.

@NamelessHoodie for the fork
@The12thAvenger

Supported games:
Dark Souls III, Full support.
Sekiro Shadows Die Twice, partial support. Many fxrs can be converted, full support is planned.

Usage:

Optional: Execute the "FXR3-XMLR_AddToContextMenu.exe" to make "FXR3" appear in your right-click on files menu

1. Drag *.fxr onto FXR3-XMLR.exe to unpack it to *.fxr.xml (or use right-click "FXR3")
2. Edit *.fxr.xml in a good text editor like Notepad++
3. Save the *.fxr.xml
4. Drag the *.fxr.xml onto FXR3-XMLR.exe to repack it to *.fxr  (or use right-click "FXR3")
